# Data description
The proposed research is to report the effects of nitrogen and plant growth regulator (PGR) applications on orchardgrass seed moisture content and seed weight over the growth stages of the crop. Shattering of the seed before harvest leads to significant economic loss since the shattered seed cannot be harvested. The broader impact of the study is to establish a recommended timing to harvest when seed crop has sufficiently matured, and shattering is not severe.
	To answer those questions, the data will include fresh seed weight, dry seed weight, seed moisture content, dry seed moisture content which will be recorded from three different spikelet and floret positions. An oven will be used to dry the seed samples and measure the dry weight. Floret will be counted at three positions of the florets. Growth stages will be taken visually using the BBCH scale. Growing degree days (GDD) will be calculated using weather temperature readings. 
	The type of data is mainly text and spreadsheets. The temperature records used for the GDD calculations will include data taken from surveys. Seed crop data will be taken from field trials where four treatments of nitrogen and PGR applications are applied to different plots giving different data. After that, the seed weight will be plotted over time and GDD to record the changes in seed weight and moisture content and eventually estimate higher seed weight and lower moisture content where harvest can be optimized by less shattering incidence. 
	The data will be collected three times a week. Flower heads will be collected around 10 am to noon. After that, 30 seed will be separated and weighed from each position on the spikelet and floret which would be 180 per flower head. After weighing, the samples are put in the oven for two hours and the dried samples are weighed again. Fresh and dry moisture content will be recorded. BBCH recordings can be taken visually, while GDD can be calculated using a base temperature, a daily minimum temperature, and daily maximum temperature reading. The temperature readings will be taken from the Hyslop Weather Station website. A total of 30,000 seed samples that will be weighed which will be recorded in Excel spreadsheets. The estimated data size will be around 2 MB.

# Roles and responsibilities
The PhD research project involves quantifying the increase of seed weight and decrease of seed moisture in response to nitrogen and plant growth regulator applications. The roles of data protection and management are divided between the PI, a research assistant (RA), and myself. Some roles and responsibilities are shared by the three people working on the project. Data collection, generation, organization, meta generation, data analysis, DMP implementation are my responsibilities. Data archiving, quality control of data are the responsibilities of the PI. Finally, instrumentation maintenance is the responsibility of the research assistant. Shared roles between the PI and I include software creation and maintenance. 
Sensitive data are information that are not usually disclosed such as student data and medical conditions. This research project does not generate or involve any sensitive data. The funding for this research was accumulated from three funding agencies. One belongs to the private sector, while the other two are foundations. There are no disclosure agreements, contracts, or data management plan requirements by the funding agencies. However, the funding agencies require the work to be either published in scientific journals or provided to farmers through extension articles. 


# Data standards and metadata
The project doesnâ€™t have any fixed guidelines or standards for metadata since the people responsible for the data are my PI and myself. Generally, metadata standards are not very common in the department. There were two metadata standards are can be applied for agricultural sciences. Both AgMES and DIF standards offer some guidelines for metadata. AgMES focuses on description, and data exchange of different types of information resources relevant to the field of agriculture, nutrition, and rural development. DIF focuses on instruments used to take spatial and temporal characteristics of data.
Data that will be generated will include seed weight values in gram, seed moisture content in percentage, number of florets per panicle, and SPAD reading values in percentages. Other data include floret weight values in gram, floret moisture content in percentage. Possible future data may include nitrogen leaf content. The x variable for the data will include growing degree days (GDD), date, and BBCH timescale if applicable at the end of data collection. Metadata standard protocols found in AgMES and DIF would be excessive for the field of study and other ways of data documentation can be more efficient. 


# Storage and security
Data will be stored in five locations. Two are cloud storages, while the other two include an external drive storage and the laptop drive which work is being done on. The last storage will be in the OSU network drive. The data will be uploaded as Excel sheets in the clouds, which are Google drive, and Box storage. The Kumo software will be used to upload data directly into two cloud storages. The data will be copied to hard-case large external drive instead of a small external flash-drive. The Excel file will be transferred using the WinSCP program to the OSU Z drive. The data will be updated monthly to maintain the data. The few precautions will include sending the data to the PI of the project, and emails where those data are sent are kept. Also, the data will be checked periodically at storages to make sure that data is not lost. 

# Access and data sharing

There are no restrictions on the data. All data will be available upon completion of data collection and analysis. This includes seed weight, seed moisture content, growing degree days, BBCH scale values, number of florets, SPAD readings. When sharing is involved, data formats will include CSV, excel, and R files that show plots. Data license will be either public domain or CCO depending on the chosen repository's guidelines used.

# Archiving and preservation

Data will be preserved in a shared drive that is accessible to the lab staff after finishing my project and graduation. Maintaining is performed by the seed lab personal including the research assistant and the PI. Other maintainers would include an extension agent working in the same field. The proposed preservation would be around 5 to 10 years. Google drive and the department drive will be used to save the project's data. All data will be in txt or csv format
